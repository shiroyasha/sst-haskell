# SST &mdash; Semaphore Status

This package contains the source code of SST, a command line utility 
for [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com/).

SST started as a [Ruby gem](https://github.com/renderedtext/semaphore-status),
but the need to produce a native binary executable led to a new forked version
written in Haskell.

**Note**: The haskell version of SST is still unstable.

## Usage

``` sh
$ sst <api_token>
shiroyasha/base_app
  - passed :: master
  - passed :: development
  - failed :: is/testing

shiroyasha/sst
  - passed :: master
  - passed :: staging
  - passed :: is/haskell
```
